# SCP: Dystopia v1 restoration

The SCP: Dystopia addon v1 (2021~2023) has been obliterated by recent Minecraft updates.
This repository is for restoring it.

Once the restoration is complete, I will merge the restored features to [main repository](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia).

I've made several attempts to remake the SCP: Dystopia addon before, but none has achieved the goal of full restoration.

With my experiences from [SCP: Dystopia Redefined](https://mcpedl.com/scp-dystopia-redefined/) and [recent alpha iterations](https://github.com/lc-studios-mc/scp-dystopia),
I can say that focusing on restoring old features while adding new *polished* features, is quite difficult.

## The Goal

The goal is to **restore features from v1 by writing most of them from scratch**.

A list of thoughts that I hope will lead me in the right direction:

- Avoid adding new features unless it is required.
- Avoid writing complex behavior pack scripts as much as possible.
  - Be especially careful with Beta APIs.
- Avoid improving front end (textures, 3D models, audio, etc.) until I'm ready to.
  - Making a good asset takes some time and dedication.
  - I want to focus on creating a good architecture.
  - I can always do this later.
